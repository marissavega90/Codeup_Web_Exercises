                <br>
                I enjoy reading. I like being quiet.

        <h2>My Favorite Quote:</h2>
            <p>
                “Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie
                <br>
                comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so
                <br>
                loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love.”
                <br>
                -Fyodor Dostoyevsky, <em>The Brothers Karmazov</em>
